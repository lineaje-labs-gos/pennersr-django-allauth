Security notice
---------------

- The Tumblr providers (both ``tumblr`` and ``tumblr_oauth2``) used mutable blog
  names as the identifier for third-party accounts. If a blog name changed and
  was then claimed by another user, that user could log in to the original
  owner's account. The providers now use the stable blog UUID instead. Thanks to
  Sanjeev Kumar for reporting.


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- Tumblr: Existing ``SocialAccount`` records will no longer be linked due to the
  switch to stable identifiers. You will need to manually handle this situation,
  see the "Account ID Change" section in the Tumblr provider docs.


65.19.6 (2026-09-30)
********************

Security notice
---------------

- The minimum OAuthLib version for the ``socialaccount`` and ``idp-oidc`` extras
  is now 4.0.0, incorporating upstream security fixes for GHSA-hj66-6f7g-4r5v
  and GHSA-xpv3-w29h-x7cv.

- The Bitbucket and Pinterest providers used mutable usernames as the identifier
  for third-party accounts. If a username changed and was then claimed by
  another user, that user could log in to the original owner's account. The
  providers now use stable identifiers instead. Thanks to Sanjeev Kumar for
  reporting.


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- Bitbucket and Pinterest: Existing ``SocialAccount`` records will no longer be
  linked due to the switch to stable identifiers.  You will need to manually
  handle this situation by populating ``SocialAccount.uid`` based on
  ``account_id`` (Bitbucket) or ``id`` (Pinterest) located in
  ``SocialAccount.extra_data``.


65.19.5 (2026-09-28)
********************

Security notice
---------------

- Account: When the potentially unsafe ``ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["*"]`` configuration
  was used, arbitrary redirect URLs were considered safe, allowing open
  redirects. The wildcard is now ignored when validating redirect
  destinations. Thanks to John Tipton and Yuji Egami for reporting.

- Headless: ``X-Session-Token`` authentication for your own APIs (DRF / Ninja)
  now uses Django's standard session auth hash check. A token is rejected after
  the password changes outside of the allauth password-change flow, instead of
  still loading the user by primary key while the session row exists.


65.19.4 (2026-09-17)
********************

Security notice
---------------

- Account: On databases with broad Unicode collations (e.g. common MySQL/MariaDB
  configurations), usernames such as ``admin`` and ``ádmin``, or email addresses
  containing compatibility characters, could authenticate the same account while
  consuming different rate limit keys. This resulted in a larger than intended
  per account rate limit. To mitigate, matching rows are now checked against the
  submitted username or email address before the password is verified. On these
  configurations, projects using username authentication must remove Django's
  ``ModelBackend`` from ``AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS``, as it does not perform this
  additional check.  Thanks to Yuji Egami for reporting.


65.19.3 (2026-09-11)
********************

Fixes
-----

- Account: The email address data migrations (``0006`` and ``0008``) did not
  honor the database selected using ``migrate --database``, potentially querying
  or updating the default database instead. Fixed.

- MFA: Fixed various race conditions involving TOTP and recovery codes.


Security notice
---------------

- Headless: When ``HEADLESS_JWT_STATEFUL_VALIDATION_ENABLED`` is on, JWT
  access tokens are now rejected after the password changes outside of the
  allauth password-change flow (for example via ``set_password()`` in a
  shell). Stateful validation now uses the same session auth hash check that
  refresh tokens already used.

- A known flaw in the built-in rate limiting was that the configured limits
  could be exceeded under a high volume of concurrent requests. This was
  documented as an acceptably small margin of error. However, as Kaya Emre Arikan
  (kemrec) demonstrated, the limits could be substantially exceeded under a
  sufficiently high volume of concurrent requests. This is now fixed by
  serializing rate limit updates.


65.19.2 (2026-09-01)
********************

Fixes
-----

- Headless: Posting a well-formed JSON payload that was not an object (e.g. a
  list or a string) to the headless endpoints resulted in a server error.

Security notice
---------------

- MFA: TOTP enrollment code verification was not rate limited. Impact is
  limited, as to exploit this you would need to be already fully authenticated,
  pass (rate-limited) reauthentication, and brute force within a 30s TOTP
  window.


65.19.1 (2026-08-13)
********************

Fixes
-----

- IdP: Fixed an incorrect URL reverse in the OpenID Connect authorization
  template. It silently resolved to an empty form action (posting back to the
  same URL), so the flow kept working regardless.

- IdP: Redirectable errors from the authorization endpoint were not delivered to
  clients registered with an app native (non-http(s)) ``redirect_uri``.


Security notice
---------------

- IdP: The OpenID Connect RP-initiated logout endpoint honored any
  ``post_logout_redirect_uri`` that could not be tied to a registered client,
  making it an open redirector. It now only redirects to URIs that can be
  verified as registered. The impact is low: no tokens or secrets are exposed,
  it merely allowed redirecting the user agent to an arbitrary URL after logout.


65.19.0 (2026-08-06)
********************

Noteworthy changes
-------------------

- Officially support Django 6.1.

- IdP: Added support for Client ID Metadata Document (CIMD).

- IdP: Added ``IDP_OIDC_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN``, allowing refresh tokens to
  expire. Combined with ``IDP_OIDC_ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKEN``, this results in a
  sliding (inactivity) window. Defaults to ``None`` (no expiry), preserving the
  previous behavior. Whenever a refresh token carries an expiry, its remaining
  lifetime is returned to the client as ``refresh_expires_in`` in the token
  response.

- IdP: Added an ``oidc_cleartokens`` management command that deletes expired
  OpenID Connect tokens.

- IdP: Added key rotation support via ``IDP_OIDC_PRIVATE_KEYS``, as well as
  cache control for the JWKS endpoint.

- IdP: Added RFC 7662 OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection support.

- The ``jwt`` and ``cryptography`` dependencies are now imported lazily.
  Deployments that register JWT-verifying providers (e.g. Google, or OpenID
  Connect) - for example, no longer pay their memory cost (roughly 8-10 MiB
  per process) unless a token is actually verified.

- On the "Change Password" form, the "Forgot password?" link has been moved into
  the password field help text, and the "Reauthenticate" form now shows it too.
  As on the login form, the link can be customized via the
  ``account/password_reset_help_text.html`` template.


Fixes
-----

- IdP: App native URLs wouldn't be accepted as ``post_logout_redirect_uri``.

- IdP: Fix ``IDP_OIDC_ID_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN`` always returning the default value, even if set in settings.


65.18.0 (2026-05-29)
********************

Noteworthy changes
-------------------

- The ``password2`` (password confirmation) field on the set/change/reset
  password forms now carries ``autocomplete="new-password"``, matching
  ``password1``. This allows browser and password manager "suggest strong
  password" features to fill both fields as a pair.

- IdP: Added support for Dynamic Client Registration.

- IdP: Added support for ``client_secret_basic``.

- IdP: Added support for Resource Indicators (RFC 8707).

- IdP: The ``.well-known/openid-configuration`` endpoint previously derived
  ``response_types_supported`` and ``grant_types_supported`` from configured
  clients. Per RFC 8414, these fields should reflect server capabilities, not
  the configuration of existing clients. They are now statically derived.
  Additionally, ``scopes_supported`` is now included. Use the new
  ``populate_server_metadata()`` adapter method to customize the metadata.


65.17.0 (2026-05-20)
********************

Noteworthy changes
-------------------

- Added new socialaccount provider: Klaviyo.

- Rate limiting now truncates IPv6 addresses to their network prefix (default
  ``/64``) to prevent bypass via address rotation. Configurable via
  ``ALLAUTH_RATE_LIMIT_IPV6_PREFIX``.

- Added ``authenticate_by_email`` hook to ``DefaultSocialAccountAdapter``,
  allowing customization of user lookup and email matching during social login.


Fixes
-----

- BitBucket: When using the BitBucket API, the token is passed in the headers
  instead of the query parameters, which no longer works since May 4th, 2026
  (`deprecation notice <https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/changelog/#CHANGE-3052>`__).


65.16.1 (2026-04-17)
********************

Security notice
---------------

- The ``state`` parameter is a critical part of the OAuth2 handshake, used to
  prevent CSRF attacks. The Edx, AngelList and Questrade providers were
  originally added without ``state`` support, as these providers did not support
  it at the time. Edx and Questrade have since added support, so their
  configuration has been updated accordingly. AngelList is no longer operational
  and has been removed. Thanks to Adil Ahmadzada for reporting.


65.16.0 (2026-04-13)
********************

Noteworthy changes
-------------------

- MFA: You can now configure recovery codes to be only shown once
  (``MFA_RECOVERY_CODES_SHOW_ONCE = True``).

- New signals for audit trail purposes: ``login_code_rejected``,
  ``password_reset_code_rejected``, ``email_verification_code_rejected`` (in
  ``allauth.account.signals``) and ``authentication_failed`` (in
  ``allauth.mfa.signals``).


65.15.1 (2026-04-02)
********************

Fixes
-----

- The context data for the various entrance views was inconsistent, e.g. some
  where missing ``site`` or ``login_url``. Ensured all entrance views are now
  handed over the same base context.

- MFA: accessing the WebAuthn login view while already being authenticated resulted
  in a 500, fixed.

- OAuth 1.0: Fixed an argument call order issue when performing requests.


65.15.0 (2026-03-09)
********************

Noteworthy changes
-------------------

- All user facing codes (e.g. those that the user needs to manually input over
  at password reset, email/phone verification, login code, OIDC device codes)
  now follow the recommendations over at `RFC 8628, Section 6.1
  <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8628#section-6.1>`_.  It uses dashed
  codes, such as "WDJB-MJHT", by default. You can control the format of all codes
  via a new setting `ALLAUTH_USER_CODE_FORMAT``, or, adjust the format per use
  case via one of ``ACCOUNT_LOGIN_BY_CODE_FORMAT``,
  ``ACCOUNT_PHONE_VERIFICATION_CODE_FORMAT``,
  ``ACCOUNT_PASSWORD_RESET_BY_CODE_FORMAT``,
  ``ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION_BY_CODE_FORMAT``, ``IDP_OIDC_USER_CODE_FORMAT``.

- Added optional support for requesting new login codes. See
  ``ACCOUNT_LOGIN_BY_CODE_SUPPORTS_RESEND``.


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- Dropped support for Python 3.8 and 3.9. Both these Python versions are
  end-of-life.


65.14.3 (2026-02-13)
********************

Fixes
-----

- Version 65.14.2 was not compatible with Python 3.8/3.9 due to use of an
  unsupported typing construct, fixed.


65.14.2 (2026-02-13)
********************

Security notice
---------------

- Rate limiting and IP address detection: as Django applications cannot reliably
  determine client IP addresses out of the box, you must override
  ``get_client_ip()`` to match your deployment architecture. If you omitted to
  do so, the default implementation trusted ``X-Forwarded-For``, which can be
  spoofed to bypass rate limits. Now, ``X-Forwarded-For`` is distrusted by
  default. You must either configure ``ALLAUTH_TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT``, rely on
  ``ALLAUTH_TRUSTED_CLIENT_IP_HEADER``, or override ``get_client_ip()``. Thanks
  to Ayato Shitomi for reporting.


65.14.1 (2026-02-07)
********************

Fixes
-----

- When using ``ACCOUNT_CHANGE_EMAIL = True``, if the user initiating the change
  email process had no verified email address, ``user.email`` would still
  reflect the old email address while the verification process was pending.

Security notice
---------------

- SAML: When IdP initiated SSO was enabled (it is by default disabled), any URL
  found in the SAML ``RelayState`` parameter would be used to redirect to,
  potentially redirecting the authenticated user to a wrong site. Thanks to
  Ayato Shitomi and Funabiki Keisuke for reporting.


65.14.0 (2026-01-17)
********************

Noteworthy changes
-------------------

- Steam: the provider now supports initiating headless logins per
  redirect.

- Shopify: if ``email_verified`` is present in the user payload, it will be used
  to mark the email address retrieved as verified accordingly.

- IdP: added support for JWT based access tokens (see
  ``IDP_OIDC_ACCESS_TOKEN_FORMAT``).

- IdP: added support for pointing to a custom userinfo endpoint (see
  ``IDP_OIDC_USERINFO_ENDPOINT``)

- For OpenID Connect providers, you can now configure the field to be used as
  the account ID by setting ``"uid_field"`` in the relevant
  ``SocialApp.settings``.

- Headless: the JWT algorithm is now configurable, supporting HS256.


Fixes
-----

- IdP: Access tokens without a user attached (client credentials) were no longer
  recognized in DRF/Ninja endpoints.

- ``requests`` sessions are now disposed of after use to avoid resource leaks.
